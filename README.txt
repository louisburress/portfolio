Louis A. Burress - DevOps Portfolio

This is my DevOps Portfolio, showcasing my expertise in building efficient, scalable cloud infrastructure and delivering automation solutions. Iâ€™m passionate about cloud technologies such as Azure, AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) through Bicep, Terraform, and AWS EC2.

Projects Featured
1. Coach Seqoiya Web Application Project
This project includes both frontend and backend services for managing and scheduling athletic training sessions. It leverages a CI/CD pipeline for automating deployments using tools like Terraform, NGINX, Docker Compose, and is hosted on AWS EC2.

Key Features:

Frontend and backend services for user and session management.
Integrated CI/CD pipeline with Terraform and AWS for automation.
Deployed using NGINX for load balancing and routing.
Hosted on an AWS EC2 instance for scalable cloud deployment.
2. Jenkins CI/CD Project
This project demonstrates Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. It includes a custom-built Python application deployed via Jenkins pipelines, with automated Docker image creation and pushing to DockerHub. The entire process runs on AWS EC2, allowing for an automated and scalable environment.
